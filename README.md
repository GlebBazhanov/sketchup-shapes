# Welcome to SketchUp Shapes extension

A SketchUp Ruby Extension that creates shape objects.

SketchUp Shape obects are simple primitive shapes that can be quickly created by filling out a template.  The objects created by the shapes extension are also parametric so they can be edited after creation.  This extension is an Open Source project and can be improved by anyone.


## Installing

The latest and greatest is available as an RBZ file from Extension Warehouse. 

Generally, the best way to install an extension is to open Extension Warehouse from inside SketchUp, searching for  "shapes" and then click the install button (you may need to sign in too).  Installing via SketchUp will automatically download , unpack and place the files in the appropriate locations.  

If you need to download from outside SketchUp, follow this url - http://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/shapes.

Then open SketchUp and select `Window → Preferences` (Microsoft Windows) or `SketchUp → Preferences` (Mac OS X) `→ Extensions → Install Extension` and select the RBZ file you just downloaded. Voila! SketchUp installs the extension. 

For developement installations you will need to copy the contents of the src file from this project, into your sketchUp plugins folder.
